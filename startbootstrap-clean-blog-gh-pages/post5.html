					<h2 class="section-heading">Who is a Villain?</h2>
					
					<p>Kool Keith is far from the first rap artist to abuse the super hero moniker in a record, in fact, the artist featured on Kool Keith’s “SUPER HERO,” is none other than Daniel “MF DOOM” Dumile. MF DOOM is a well-known name among the underground and mainstream rap tapestry, being touted as “your favorite rapper’s favorite rapper” according to posts on social media and across various online interviews. </p>
					
					<p>MF DOOM is a particularly fascinating case-study in rap artists’ use of myth because he chooses specifically to be portrayed as a supervillain instead of the titular role of a superhero. MF DOOM chooses the classic look of Marvel’s “Doctor Doom” for which he bases the character’s aesthetics upon. Why, then, besides the coincidental name and alluring mask design, did Dumile choose a villain rather than a hero? It begins in Medieval times as the Latin language was being developed. According to both Oxford and Meriam-Webster, the term we know today came from the word “villein,” as in someone residing in a village that was of a lower social class than the thane, knight, or landowner. This lower social class reduced the villein to a lower moral standing as well, leading it to eventually become the word we know today. To be a villain by these technical standards is to be of a lower status, a status that Dumile whole-heartedly accepts in his many characterizations, although it is also someone who rejects the imposed status quo, embracing their own codes of conduct.</p>
					
					<p>Early in Dumile’s career he had already begun to embrace this rejection from the mainstream in his early rap group, KMD (Kause Much Damage). Here, Dumile would experiment with new flows, styles, and lyrical compositions that would stand out from his other bandmates. This experimentation with avant-garde melodic flows would later earn Dumile a unique and recognizable sound in tone and quality, further cementing the ideal of the villain even in his musicality. </p>
					
					<p>In his more recent works, however, MF DOOM would fully embrace his villainous nature with his critically acclaimed record Madvillainy, a duo project with his long-time producer Otis “Madlib” Jackson Jr. The most popular song on the record also explains some of the in-depth lore of the MF DOOM mythology, as well as the music video being deeply inspired by the art styles of post-war superhero comic books.</p>

					<p>“All Caps” is the current most played track off of the duo’s debut album and stands near the top when referring to MF DOOM’s all-time most popular tracks. At only a little over two minutes and containing only two verses, there is still plenty of intellectual material to unpack in regard to the lore behind the lyrics. MF DOOM switches perspectives plenty throughout many of his songs, first regaling us of his tale of conquering the genre by force in the line “Having me, then he told the people ‘You can call me Your Majesty,’” an adequately villainous line to start the track. MF DOOM goes on to rap about a scuffle between him and some other rapper with the lines, “Plus nobody couldn’t do nothin’ once he let the brick go” and “The beat is so butter, peep the slow cutter.” In the former, MF DOOM imposes a suprahuman feature into his lyricism by saying that he cannot be stopped once the fight breaks out. In the latter, MF DOOM is referring to the smoothness of the beat and the fact that, while his lyrics may be slow, he can still cut through any challenge that lies ahead. The final bar of the first verse is also interesting in that MF DOOM cements himself as a figurehead above others while still mentioning his innately human disposition, as he says, “Just remember ALL CAPS when you spell the man name.”</p>
