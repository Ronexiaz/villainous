					<h2 class="section-heading">What is Myth?</h2>
					
                    <p>Modern mythographers differ wildly on this subject, each with their own specific interpretation of what exactly a myth is. There does exist one such mythographer, however, who has taken this notion to task, defining a wide-ranging definition of myth. This mythographer is known as William G. Doty. Doty has nearly 300 peer-reviewed, written works on the subject of mythography and has attempted to nail the definition down multiple times. In one of his more recent works, <i>Mythography : The Study of Myths and Rituals</i>, Doty provides a framework for which a myth could play in, rather than attempting to hold it down in one specific area. For a story to branch into a work of myth it must satisfy these ten conditions laid out by Doty, it must be/have: a network of stories to draw upon, culturally important, imaginative, story-like, metaphoric and symbolic diction, graphic imagery, emotional conviction and participation, primal, foundational accounts, the real, experienced world, humankind’s roles and relative statuses. These elements form what will be used as the general framework for a myth. </p>

                    <p>While most of these are self-explanatory, there are a few that are harder to pin down. For instance, when Doty refers to myths as being “primal, foundational accounts,” he means that they must be the primary source for an existing ideal that we base others on. Christian myth, for instance, begins with such an account: Christ was dead and has risen after three days. This is the primary account as well as a foundational account of what further Christian beliefs and culture is centered on. </p>

                    <p>Doty, however, does not stop there, he goes on to define a “creative myth,” something that conveys values and systems of interpreting reality beyond a shared mythical understanding. This type of myth includes many modern variations of myth and is well suited to the contemporary messages of today. Doty defines a creative myth using all of the above elements as well as having, political and moral values, systems of interpretation, individual experiences within universal perspectives, intervention of suprahuman entities, aspects of natural and cultural orders, ceremony/drama, and secondary elaborations. Again, some of these elements are easily understood at face value, although some will require some explanation. Creative myths (or modern myths), in Doty’s definition, deal in more concrete terms than their more general counterparts. Such concrete dealings can be found in the idea of the “suprahuman,” an ideal of humankind that intervenes in situations where a deity traditionally would be seen; a good example can be seen in some superheroes of the modern era, very clearly and understandably human with a mythical twist. Another element that is mightily important in regard to modern myth is the element of a “secondary elaboration.” A secondary elaboration is the corroboration or “appropriation” of myth, as Doty says. These appropriations lead to the shared recreation or reinterpretation of myths and their meanings, allowing their subjects and themes to remain culturally relative despite the passage of time. </p>
